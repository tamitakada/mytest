# MyTest | Flutter Desktop Study App

**MyTest** is a Flutter desktop app that allows users to create sets of flashcards that they can practice through randomized tests. Currently only available in Japanese and for macOS.

## Distribution

**MyTest** is distributed [here](https://tamitakada.github.io/mytest-website/). A preview with screenshots is also available from the linked website.

> **Feature Spotlight: Flexible Answers**  
> Along with an optional setting that allows for up to 10% error in responses to account for typos and negligible errors, you can mark a section of an answer to a question as optional by putting it in square brackets (e.g. `[this is optional]`). You can also include multiple possible answers by separating them with a ・ character (e.g. `answer 1・answer 2・answer 3`).
